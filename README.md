# INKLUSIVA Call

INKLUSIVA Call is a friendly [Jitsi](https://github.com/jitsi|Jitsi) Fork which enables accessible video meetings on the internet. 

**This repository is the web-application for onboarding INKLUSIVA-Call participants with the Accessibility-Assistant.**

Personal settings for INKLUSIVA Call can be determined before joining a meeting, depending on which functions the user needs. For this, there is the so-called Accessibility Assistant. This is a form that asks for the desired settings.
* Settings can be changed at any time during the meeting.
* Settings can be saved in the web browser or downloaded as a file.
* The next time INKLUSIVA Call is used, the file with the settings can be uploaded again. Then the settings will be restored.
* The Accessibility Assistant can also be skipped. In this case, standard settings are active.
